# simple-genetic-algorithm
A basic implementation of a genetic algorithm with the goal to find optimal solutions for the Knapsack problem.

As a basis for an individual integer sequences are used, which allows an adaptation to further problems, provided that possible solutions can be encoded as a series of integers.
